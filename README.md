# Turtle-Race
A racing game where the winner is randomly decided

The rules for the game are simple. Before each race begins you will be given the choice
between 6 different images to use as a location for each race. just enter the number for the 
corresponding image and it will then show up on the window. 

You will then be asked how many people will be playing in the game. Up to 8 people can have their 
own turtle in the race, but there must be a minimum of two players chosen for the game to run. 

After the number of players is decided then each player will pick a color. Only one person can
pick a color at a time, but each person will be given the option to change their color after each race.

After the colors are picked then the race will begin. Each player will be shown their position in the screen
and how close they were to the next player. It will also keep track of how many wins each player has as long
as the game is open.
